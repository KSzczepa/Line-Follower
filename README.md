<h1>Line-Follower Robot</h1>
<h2>Project assumptions</h2>
<p>The aim of the project was to create a robot that follows a line marking a track. Using an STM32 microcontroller, an optimal algorithm had to be written, taking into account smooth travel along the track at the highest possible speed. A PID controller algorithm was designed for this purpose. An additional difficulty was to attach a remote control with an infrared receiver to the project in order to switch the robot on/off using a button.</p>
